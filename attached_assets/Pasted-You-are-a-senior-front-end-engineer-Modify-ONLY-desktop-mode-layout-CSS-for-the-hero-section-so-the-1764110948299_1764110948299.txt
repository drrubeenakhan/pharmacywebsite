You are a senior front-end engineer. Modify ONLY desktop mode layout/CSS for the hero section so the UI is perfectly usable and responsive on desktop while using a fixed background image that never interferes with UI interaction.

Background image (hero-only): url("/mnt/data/ecf32f85-ad6a-4d73-9789-6476aad7770a.jpg")

Non-negotiables

Mobile styling must remain exactly unchanged. Touch desktop only using min-width media queries (or Tailwind lg: / xl: / 2xl:).

Do not change copy, labels, component content, or overall page structure.

Do not add/remove UI elements or sections.

Only allowed edits: desktop-only layout rules, spacing, max widths, grid/flex behavior, clamp sizing, and hero-only background layering.

Background image requirements (must implement exactly)

The background must be applied ONLY to the hero and must not appear elsewhere.

The background must be fixed (parallax-style) on desktop: background-attachment: fixed;

The background must be visually responsive: background-size: cover; background-position: center;

The background must not capture clicks or affect scrolling: put it on a separate layer with pointer-events: none; and correct z-index stacking.

Add an optional minimal scrim overlay (hero-only) to guarantee text readability. Keep it subtle.

Desktop usability requirements

Must look correct and readable at these desktop widths:
1024, 1280, 1440, 1680, 1920, 2560

No overlapping UI

No horizontal scrollbars

No clipped CTAs/cards

No awkward empty space at the bottom of the hero

Two-column hero on desktop (left content, right card), collapsing to one column only when needed on desktop threshold.

Required implementation pattern

Use a .hero wrapper with:

position: relative; overflow: clip; isolation: isolate;

A background layer implemented either via:

::before absolute layer with background-image and background-attachment: fixed, OR

a dedicated .heroBg child div behind content
In both cases: pointer-events: none; z-index: 0;

Optional ::after scrim overlay above background but below content (z-index: 1)

Content wrapper .heroInner above everything (z-index: 2)
