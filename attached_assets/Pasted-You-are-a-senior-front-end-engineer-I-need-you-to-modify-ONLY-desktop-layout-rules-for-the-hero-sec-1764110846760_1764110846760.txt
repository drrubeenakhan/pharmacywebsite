You are a senior front-end engineer. I need you to modify ONLY desktop layout rules for the hero section shown in this screenshot. Mobile must remain exactly as-is. Do not redesign components, do not change copy, do not change the app structure outside the hero.

Reference image (for context only): /mnt/data/ecf32f85-ad6a-4d73-9789-6476aad7770a.jpg

Objective

Fix desktop mode responsiveness/usability so the hero layout looks intentional and consistent at these widths:
1024, 1280, 1440, 1680, 1920, 2560.

Hard constraints

Do not change mobile styling at all. Mobile behavior must be untouched.

Do not change any text, labels, buttons, or content order.

Do not add new UI sections.

Only allowed edits: desktop-only CSS/Tailwind classes, spacing, grid/flex rules, max-widths, clamp sizing, and hero-only background layering.

The handprints asset is a hero-only background layer (not content), pointer-events: none, and must not appear outside the hero.

No horizontal scrollbars. No overlapping UI. No awkward empty bottom space.

Required solution pattern (desktop-only)

Implement desktop changes using only min-width media queries (or Tailwind lg:/xl: etc) so nothing affects mobile:

Hero wrapper: stable min-height and controlled overflow.

Centered content container with a max width (pick the best value).

Two-column layout on desktop: left = headline/CTAs, right = status card.

Collapse to one column only when the viewport is too narrow for the two-column layout (desktop threshold only).

Add a subtle hero-only scrim overlay for readability if needed, but keep the look minimal.

Deliverables

Return:

The exact desktop-only CSS (or Tailwind class changes) to apply to:

.hero wrapper

inner container

left content block

right status card block

hero background layers (::before + optional ::after scrim)

If you need to introduce wrapper divs, do it minimally and show the updated snippet.

A tiny “tested widths” checklist confirming no overlap and no horizontal scroll at each target width.

Output rules

Provide copy-pasteable code blocks only.

Do not include explanations beyond the required checklist.

If you must choose between background-size: cover vs contain, choose one and implement it (no debate).
